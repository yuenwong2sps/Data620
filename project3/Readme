Abstract
Purchasing history from customer is an important asset for eCommerce company.  By studying the purchasing relationship, we could identify some customer's interests by similar purchases.
 
Data
We used Amazon products sold records in 2006 summer. There are three types of products: books, DVDs, Music CDs and Videos. In the dataset, each product title, sales rank, list of similar products, category and product review including individual rating from users.  By using the co-purchasing data and item data (Amazon-meta), we can perform network analysis.
 
There are 548,552 nodes and 1,788,725 edges in the data.

https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0601.html - Amazon product co-purchaisng network from June 01 2003

Filter Data
We will filter data by top 100 most reviewed products instead of the entire dataset (see the jypter notebook for the step by step process).

The python code in the jypter notebook is designed to process the raw files that can be found from link above.  And the output are csv file:

top100_edges.csv - edge file for top 100 most reviewed product
top100_nodes.csv - node file for the top 100 most review edge file
